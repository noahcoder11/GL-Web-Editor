A quick syntax review-- in both the
vertex shader and the frgament shader,
you are able to retrieve values from
the JS code that you set in there. This
is similar to how WebGL works with its
shaders in GLSL.

So, first up, we want to get the vertices
that we made before in the JS code, right?
Well, I ahve created a special syntax in
these two shaders that allows you to grab
different variable types.

Now before we get to that, let's first go
over what these variable types are:
1. Attributes
    These are variables that change
    depending on the vertex-- an example
    would be, obviously, the vertex position

    These are referenced like so (with
    an "@" character before:
    @attribute_name

2. Uniforms
    These are variables that simply
    DO NOT CHANGE. They are just stores
    for data from the outside, like say
    a texture sampler, to be passed to the
    inside.
    
    These are referenced like so (with
    a "#" character before:
    #uniform_name
    
3. Varying - these do not work in the
vertex shader, as nothing has been
interpolated yet
    We will go more in-depth into these later
    as we begin to cover the workings behind
    the scenes with interpolation, but for
    now, suffice it to say that these are
    also values that change depending on the
    vertex, but they also vary depending on
    the pixel of the triangle-- these are the
    values that get interpolated across the
    triangle
    
    These are referenced like so (with
    a "$" character before:
    $varying_name

<- Now you can go back to the previous window
to learn how to create these useful variables
